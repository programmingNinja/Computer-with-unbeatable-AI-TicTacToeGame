Program: Unbeatable Computer AI Tic Tac Toe Game.

Computer-with-unbeatable-AI-TicTacToeGame
=========================================

This is a java program for a tic tac toe game having a computer player having unbeatable AI

Description:
===========

This is the tic tac toe game developed in JAVA and it has an unbeatable computer player. The computer player cannot lose
however the game can even be drawn.
This game is a console based game devoid of any graphics. It is programmed in an object oriented fashion.

Algorithm:
==========

It uses Min-Max algorithm to calculate the best move.


Execution:
==========
Option A:

1) Clone the repo
2) Import this project in your JAVA IDE
3) Compile it
4) Run it
5) Play the game

Option B:

1) Clone the repo
2) Open command prompt
3) Locate the jar file in the project folder
4) Run the jar file
5) Play the game on the command prompt window

Note: The project folder is inside the repo (named "TicTacToeComputer") and not the repo itself

Future Work:
============

1) Even though the Min-Max algorithm does the work, and Tic Tac Toe is not a computationally heavy game, the program can be made more efficient by using the Min-Max with Alpha Beta pruning algorithm instead of just Min-Max algorithm. This will not make a considerable or even noticeable difference in the working of the game but alpha beta pruning is more efficient than min-max.
2) Giving the game some graphics so that it can not only be run on a console.
3) Combining the simple two player tic-tac-toe game (can find the game in an another repo), with the unbeatable computer tic-tac-toe game and giving the user to select who he wants to play against? Computer or another human player.
